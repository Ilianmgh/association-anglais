        <h3>Geography and Ecological Zones</h3>
        <p>
            Kenya has a wide variety of landscapes due to its location along the equator. There are beaches and mangroves along the Indian Ocean coast, savannas in the south and east, and mountains like Mount Kenya in the center. The highlands are fertile and support most of the country's farming and population. The north is more arid, with semi-desert and desert regions. This geographical diversity strongly shapes the country’s climate and ecosystems.

        <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>
            Kenya is home to some of the richest biodiversity in Africa. It hosts the famous "Big Five" — lions, elephants, rhinos, buffalos, and leopards — as well as giraffes, zebras, and many types of antelope. Birdlife is also abundant, with over 1,000 species recorded. Much of this wildlife is protected in national parks and reserves across the country. These natural areas are also key to Kenya’s tourism industry, which supports many local economies.

        <h3>Environmental Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            Kenya faces several serious environmental challenges today. Deforestation is a major issue, especially in highland forests like the Mau Forest. Poaching, although reduced, still threatens endangered species like rhinos and elephants. Climate change causes more frequent and longer droughts, which affect farming and wildlife. Pollution, especially from plastic waste and untreated sewage, also harms natural habitats.

        <h3>Protection Initiatives</h3>
        <p>
            Kenya has taken many steps to protect its environment. The country banned single-use plastic bags in 2017, becoming a model for other African nations. It also invests in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal power to reduce emissions. Reforestation campaigns are underway to restore degraded forests and increase tree cover. Anti-poaching laws have become stricter, with heavy penalties for illegal wildlife trafficking.

        <h3>Ecological Role and Future</h3>
        <p>
            With its rich biodiversity and unique ecosystems, Kenya plays a crucial role in African conservation efforts. The country aims to balance economic development with environmental protection, which remains a complex challenge. Environmental education is growing, especially among the youth. Local communities are increasingly involved in the sustainable management of natural resources. The future of Kenya’s environment will depend on strong policies, science, and citizen engagement.
